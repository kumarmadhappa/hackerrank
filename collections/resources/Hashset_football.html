HashSet in Java</h1></section><section class="question-view__instruction"><div class="candidate-rich-text"><div id="2ja30kbag67-instruction"><p>A football team has played n matches in a tournament. They have played each match with different sets of players (some players may have continuously&nbsp;played in some of the matches). You have to write a program to find the players who have played all the matches and the players who have played in a particular match and not in the other mentioned match.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Input Specifications:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The first line consists of an integer n denoting the number of matches.</li>
	<li>The second line consists of a single string containing the squad of players in each match, separated by a #. The players in a particular match are separated by a single space (the players for a single match may contain duplicates as well, you need to remove the&nbsp;duplicates).</li>
	<li>The last two lines consist&nbsp;of two integers x and y, which denotes the match numbers depending on which you have to find the players who have played in match y, but&nbsp;not in x.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Output Specifications:</strong></p>

<p>Output a string with the players who have played all the matches with the names separated by a single space, followed by a comma and space, and the players who have played match number y and have not played match number x with the names separated by a single space.</p>
