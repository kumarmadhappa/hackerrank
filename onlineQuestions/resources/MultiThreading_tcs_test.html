Working with Multithreading</h1></section><section class="question-view__instruction"><div class="candidate-rich-text"><div id="42fj3aqjage-instruction"><p>You will be given an array of size 300. The name of the array is threadArray, and the index of the array should be referenced by using a variable name i.</p>

<p>(Note: The variables&nbsp;threadArray, and i (variable name to access the index of the array) are declared in the predefined class solution).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have to insert elements into the array using three threads by creating three classes,&nbsp;namely Task1, Task2, and Task3, respectively. The values to be inserted into the array are 0,1,2,3,.....299.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You should override the run method in the threads. Three integers i, j, and k will be given, representing the number of elements each thread should append inside the given array.<br>
Thread one should append 0 to i-1 inside the array, thread two should append i to i+j-1 inside the array, and the third thread should append i+j to 299 inside the array.<br>
Threads one and two must run simultaneously, and the values of the threads one and two must be inserted&nbsp;inside the indices of the array from 0 to i+j-1 randomly. The third thread should start only after the first two threads have been executed completely.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Input Specifications:</strong><br>
The first line is an integer representing the number of elements to be inserted inside the array by thread one.<br>
The second line is an integer representing the number of elements to be inserted inside the array by thread two.<br>
The third line is an integer representing the number of elements to be inserted inside the array by thread three.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Output Specifications:</strong><br>
The output should be true if the processes are executed in the correct order.&nbsp;Otherwise, it should be false.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sample Input:</strong><br>
80<br>
130<br>
90</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sample Output:</strong><br>
true (if both the threads one and two have run simultaneously and the third thread has run after&nbsp;them), or false (if threads one and two have not run&nbsp;simultaneously and thread three has started before threads one and two have got completed).</p>
