/**
 * Given two integer arrays A and B of size N.
 * 
 * <br>There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at
 * station i is A[i].
 * 
 * <br>You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs B[i] of gas to travel
 * from station i to its next station (i+1). 
 * 
 * <p>You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of
 * the gas stations.
 * <br>Return the minimum starting gas station’s index if you can travel around the
 * circuit once, otherwise return -1.
 * 
 * <br>You can only travel in one direction. i to i+1, i+2, … n-1, 0, 1, 2..
 * Completing the circuit means starting at i and ending up at i again.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * <p>Input Format
 * 
 * <br>The first argument given is the integer array A. The second argument given is
 * the integer array B. Output Format
 * 
 * <br>Return the minimum starting gas station's index if you can travel around the
 * circuit once, otherwise return -1. For Example
 * 
 * <p>Input 1: A = [1, 2] B = [2, 1] Output 1: 1 
 * <p>Explanation 1: 
 * <br>If you start from
 * index 0, you can fill in A[0] = 1 amount of gas. <br>Now your tank has 1 unit of
 * gas. But you need B[0] = 2 gas to travel to station 1. 
 * <br>If you start from
 * index 1, you can fill in A[1] = 2 amount of gas. Now your tank has 2 units of
 * gas. You need B[1] = 1 gas to get to station 0. So, you travel to station 0
 * and still have 1 unit of gas left over. You fill in A[0] = 1 unit of
 * additional gas, making your current gas = 2. It costs you B[0] = 2 to get to
 * station 1, which you do and complete the circuit.
